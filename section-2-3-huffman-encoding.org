#+TITLE: 2.3 Example: Huffman Encoding

* Exercise 2.67
Define a encoding tree and a sample message:

#+begin_src scheme :eval never
(define sample-tree
  (make-code-tree
   (make-leaf 'A 4)
   (make-code-tree
    (make-leaf 'B 2)
    (make-code-tree
     (make-leaf 'D 1)
     (make-leaf 'C 1)))))

(define sample-message
  '(0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0))
#+end_src

Use the decode procedure to decode the message, and give the result.

** Solution
Tree graph:

#+INCLUDE: "2_68-tree-graph.dot" src dot :file 2_68-tree-graph.png

Decoding result:
#+begin_example
$1 = (A D A B B C A)
#+end_example

* TODO 2.68 to 2.72
